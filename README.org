* NESTA in Python
This is an attempt to migrate the NESTA package
(https://statweb.stanford.edu/~candes/nesta/), which is originally implemented
in MATLAB, to Python. My guess is this attempt will probably fail pretty soon,
but I'd like to give it a try anyway.

** Plan
   1. Migrate everything needed to make TV denoising work
   2. Migrate the example of solving a TV denoising problem
   3. Something else...
