* l1magic in Python
This is an attempt to migrate the infamous l1magic package
(https://statweb.stanford.edu/~candes/l1magic/), which is originally implemented
in MATLAB, to Python. My guess is this attempt will probably fail pretty soon,
but I'd like to give it a try anyway.

** Plan
   1. Migrate everything needed to make tvqc_logbarrier work
   2. Migrate the example of solving a tvqc problem
   3. Migrate l1qc_logbarrier
   4. Migrate the example of solving a l1qc problem
